### Step 2: Initialize Local Git Repository

```bash
cd d:\Projects\mcp-data-analysis-toolkit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete MCP Data Analysis Toolkit with Claude Desktop integration"
```

### Step 3: Connect to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-data-analysis-toolkit.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

In your GitHub repository:

1. **Go to Settings > General**
   - Add topics: `mcp`, `python`, `data-analysis`, `ai`, `claude-desktop`, `anthropic`
   - Enable Issues and Wiki

2. **Go to Settings > Pages**
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Your docs will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/mcp-data-analysis-toolkit/`

3. **Create Repository Description**
